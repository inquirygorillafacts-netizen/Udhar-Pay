<h2>Shipping and Delivery Policy</h2>

<h3>1. Nature of Service</h3>
<p>Udhar Pay is a digital financial service provider. We offer a mobile application that functions as a digital ledger for tracking credit and payments between customers and shopkeepers.</p>

<h3>2. No Physical Goods</h3>
<p>Our business provides a purely digital service. <strong>We do not sell, ship, or deliver any physical goods or products.</strong></p>

<h3>3. No Shipping Involved</h3>
<p>As we do not deal with physical products, there is no shipping, handling, or delivery process involved in the use of our services. The "transactions" on our platform are digital records of financial agreements between users and do not correspond to the shipment of any items by Udhar Pay.</p>
<p>Therefore, a shipping policy is not applicable to our business model.</p>
