<h2>2. Service Description</h2>
<p>Udhar Pay is a digital ledger platform that facilitates the tracking of credit (udhaar) and payments between customers and shopkeepers. We are a technology provider and are not a party to any transaction between users.</p>

<h2>4. Platform Commission</h2>
<p>A commission of 2.5% is levied on the principal amount of every credit transaction. This commission amount is added to the customer's outstanding balance payable to the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper receives the full principal amount of the credit, and the commission is collected by Udhar Pay from the customer as part of their repayment.</p>
