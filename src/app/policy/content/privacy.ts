<p>Last updated on March 19th, 2024</p>

<h3>1. Introduction to Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") applies to your use of the Udhar Pay application (e.g., Android and iOS) (collectively, the "Udhar Pay Platform" or "App"). However, it does not apply to any third-party websites linked to the App or to any relationships you may have with businesses listed on Udhar Pay.</p>
<p>The terms "we," "our," and "us" refer to Udhar Pay, and the terms "you," "your," and "User" refer to you as a user of Udhar Pay. The term "Personal Information" means information that you provide to us that personally identifies you, such as your name, phone number, email address, and any other data linked to such information.</p>
<p>Our practices and procedures regarding the collection and use of Personal Information are outlined below to ensure the safe use of the App. We have implemented reasonable security practices and procedures appropriate to the nature of the information and our business. While we strive to provide security that exceeds industry standards, due to the inherent vulnerabilities of the internet, we cannot guarantee complete security of all information transmitted to us by you.</p>
<p>By visiting or using the App, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy and consent to the collection, use, processing, and sharing of your Personal Information as described below. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not use the App. Please note that the separately provided Terms and Conditions form an integral part of your use of this App and should be read in conjunction with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>2. Information we collect and how we use it</h3>
<p>We collect and store your Personal Information. If you provide your third-party account credentials ("Third Party Account Information") to us, you understand that, upon your authorization, certain content and information from those accounts may be transmitted to your Udhar Pay account. Any Third Party Account Information transmitted to us will be covered by this Privacy Policy. You may choose not to provide certain information; however, this may prevent you from registering with us or using some of our features and services.</p>
<p>We use commercially reasonable efforts to limit the collection of Personal Information to what is necessary to fulfill the purposes identified below. If we use or plan to use your information for a purpose different from the one for which it was collected, we will request your consent beforehand.</p>
<p>The Personal Information we collect will be used solely to enable you to use the services provided by us, promote a safe and secure experience, assess user interest in our products and services, inform you about online offers and updates, troubleshoot issues, customize your experience, detect and prevent errors, fraud, and other criminal activity, process payments, enforce our terms and conditions, and fulfill any other purpose disclosed to you at the time of collection.</p>

<h3>3. Account information of Merchants (Shopkeepers)</h3>
<p>If you create an account to take advantage of the full range of services offered on Udhar Pay, we ask for and record Personal Information such as your name, email address, and mobile number.
