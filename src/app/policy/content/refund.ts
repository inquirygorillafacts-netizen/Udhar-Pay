<h2>Policy on Refunds, Returns, and Cancellations</h2>

<p>Udhar Pay is a technology platform that acts as a digital ledger to facilitate the recording and tracking of financial transactions between its users (customers and shopkeepers). We are not a direct seller of any goods or services.</p>

<h3>1. No Refunds or Returns Handled by Udhar Pay</h3>
<p>All transactions recorded on the Udhar Pay app, including credit (udhaar) and payments, are agreements made directly between the customer and the shopkeeper. Udhar Pay is not a party to these transactions.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>Udhar Pay does not handle, process, or mediate any requests for refunds, returns, or cancellations.</strong></p>

<h3>2. Disputes and Resolutions</h3>
<p>Any dispute regarding the quality of goods, services rendered, payment amounts, or requests for refunds must be settled directly between the customer and the shopkeeper. Udhar Pay does not have the authority or responsibility to intervene in such disputes.</p>

<h3>3. Transaction Finality</h3>
<p>Once a payment is made through the payment gateway integrated with our app, it is considered final as far as the Udhar Pay platform is concerned. The settlement of funds to the shopkeeper's account will proceed as per the payment gateway's policies and our settlement cycle.</p>
<p>We strongly advise users to confirm all transaction details before making a payment.</p>
