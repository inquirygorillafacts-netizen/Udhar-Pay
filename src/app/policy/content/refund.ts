<h2>Policy on Refunds, Returns, and Cancellations</h2>
<p>Last Updated: March 20, 2024</p>

<h3>1. Udhar Pay's Role as a Platform</h3>
<p>Udhar Pay is a technology platform that acts as a digital ledger to facilitate the recording and tracking of financial transactions (credit/udhaar and payments) between its users, who are independent customers and shopkeepers (merchants).</p>
<p><strong>We are not a seller of any goods or services.</strong> The actual contract for sale is directly between the customer and the shopkeeper.</p>

<h3>2. No Refunds, Returns, or Cancellations Handled by Udhar Pay</h3>
<p>All transactions for goods or services, and any subsequent agreements regarding returns or refunds, are made directly between the customer and the shopkeeper. Udhar Pay is not a party to these private agreements.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>Udhar Pay does not handle, process, mediate, or assume any responsibility for requests for refunds, returns, or cancellations of orders.</strong></p>

<h3>3. Dispute Resolution is Between User and Merchant</h3>
<p>Any dispute regarding the following must be settled directly between the customer and the shopkeeper:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The quality, quantity, or delivery of goods or services.</li>
    <li>Discrepancies in payment amounts.</li>
    <li>Requests for a refund of a payment already made.</li>
    <li>Requests to return a product.</li>
    <li>Cancellation of an order or service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Udhar Pay does not have the authority or the obligation to intervene in such disputes.</p>

<h3>4. Transaction Finality on the Platform</h3>
<p>Once a payment is successfully processed through the integrated payment gateway (Razorpay), it is considered final from the perspective of the Udhar Pay platform. The settlement of these funds to the shopkeeper's account will proceed according to the payment gateway's policies and our settlement cycle.</p>
<p>Any reversal of this payment (a refund) must be initiated by the shopkeeper to the customer through their own means, outside of the Udhar Pay application.</p>
<p><strong>We strongly advise all users to confirm transaction details, including the amount and intended recipient, before making any payment.</strong></p>
