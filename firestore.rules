/**
 * @fileoverview
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and restricts OTP verification access to the associated phone number.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}/profile: Stores user profile information, directly owned by the user.
 * - /otp_verifications/{phoneNumber}: Stores OTP verification details, indexed by phone number.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own profile data.
 * - OTP verification documents can be created without authentication, but only the associated phone number can read or write.
 * - Listing of user profiles and OTP verifications is disallowed to prevent information disclosure.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - User profiles are stored under /users/{userId}/profile, ensuring the user ID is readily available in the path for authorization checks,
 *   removing the need to read the document to determine ownership.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - User profiles and OTP verification data are stored in separate collections, reflecting their distinct access control requirements.
