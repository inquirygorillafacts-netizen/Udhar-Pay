    "reasoning": "This Firestore data structure is designed to support the 'Offline First' PWA application, focusing on user authentication and profile management while adhering to the core design principles of Authorization Independence, Clarity of Intent, DBAC, and QAPs. The structure separates user profiles and OTP verification data into distinct collections, each following path-based ownership for private data and leveraging structural segregation. This design supports secure list operations and makes authorization rules simple and efficient, enhancing the application's security and debuggability.\n\nAuthorization Independence is achieved by directly linking the UserProfile document to the user's UID via the path `/users/{userId}/profile`, eliminating the need for `get()` calls in security rules to validate ownership. Similarly, OTP verification data is stored under `/otp_verifications/{phoneNumber}` with the document ID being the phone number, ensuring each document is independent and manageable. This structure supports the QAP by enabling simple security rules that grant access based on the authenticated user's UID and/or phone number without complex filtering or hierarchical dependencies."
